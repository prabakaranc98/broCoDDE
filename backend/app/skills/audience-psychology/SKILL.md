# Audience Psychology Skill

## LinkedIn Audience Architecture

### The Three Rings
1. **Inner Ring** — Peers, researchers, practitioners who know your work. They engage with DMs, substantive comments, and referrals. Save rate is the signal.
2. **Middle Ring** — Professionals in adjacent fields. They save, reshare, and may follow if content bridges to their world.
3. **Outer Ring** — General tech/business audience. High impressions, low quality engagement. Avoid optimizing for this ring.

### What Inner Ring Responds To
- Genuine intellectual struggle — not conclusions, the process
- Domain-specific precision — they notice when you get details right
- Contrarian claims with evidence — challenges their assumptions respectfully
- Personal field notes — war stories with transferable lessons
- Cross-domain connections — especially when they hadn't seen it

### What Kills Inner Ring Engagement
- Credential-stating (they already know, or they don't care about the name)
- Motivational tone
- Oversimplification of problems they work on daily
- Engagement bait

## LinkedIn Algorithm Behavior (2026)
- First 60 minutes after posting is the primary engagement window
- Save rate is weighted higher than comments for distribution
- Comment quality > comment count (algorithm detects substantive threads)
- Native carousels and text outperform link posts
- 3000 character limit; optimal is 1200-1800 for text posts
- Line breaks matter — short paragraphs get more reads

## Content by Intent → Metric Target
| Intent | Primary signal | Secondary signal |
|---|---|---|
| Teach | Saves | Reshares |
| Connect | Comments (inner ring) | DMs |
| Curate | Saves | Follows |
| Provoke | Comments | Profile visits |
| Demonstrate | Inner-ring DMs | Saves |
| Bridge | Reshares | Memorability |
