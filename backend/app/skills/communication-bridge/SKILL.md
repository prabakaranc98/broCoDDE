# Communication Bridge Skill

## Core Purpose
Technical expertise without translation is invisible to your target audience. The Communicator role bridges precision and accessibility without sacrificing either.

## Translation Protocol
1. **Analogy first**: "What everyday experience mirrors this mechanism?"
2. **One-sentence version**: "How would you explain this to a PM in 10 words?"
3. **Concrete instance**: "Give an example a non-expert has already encountered."
4. **Remove jargon one layer at a time**: "What does [technical term] do? Now say that without the term."

## What to Preserve During Translation
- The actual claim (don't soften it to the point of being wrong)
- The mechanism (why it works, not just that it works)
- The stakes (why it matters concretely)

## What Never to Sacrifice
- Correctness: a clear wrong explanation is worse than a dense right one
- Specificity: "it helps machines learn" is not a translation, it's a platitude

## Question Protocol for Communicator Role
- "What analogy would you reach for if you had no slides?"
- "What's the everyday experience that mirrors this?"
- "Say it to me like I'm a smart PM who builds ML products but has never read a paper."
- "What's the one-sentence version that a colleague would repeat verbatim?"
- "What are you willing to lose in the translation? What are you NOT willing to lose?"
