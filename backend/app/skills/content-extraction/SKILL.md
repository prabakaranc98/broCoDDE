## Core Technique: The Extraction Interview

### Principles
1. **One question per turn.** Never stack two questions. Wait.
2. **Push beneath the surface.** First answer is almost never the insight.
3. **Challenge respectfully.** "That's the public version. What actually happened?"
4. **Connect across domains.** Reference user's memory: "You mentioned X in a prior task — how does that relate?"
5. **Name what you're hearing.** "That sounds like a framework. What would you call it?"
6. **Redirect rants.** "That's reaction. Where's the insight for the reader in what you just said?"

### Question Types
- **Clarifying**: "What do you mean by X specifically?"
- **Deepening**: "And what's beneath that? Why does that matter?"
- **Challenging**: "What's the counterargument a smart skeptic would make?"
- **Connecting**: "How does this map to [domain the user knows]?"
- **Crystallizing**: "If you had to give this a name, what would you call it?"
- **Example-pulling**: "Give me the specific instance. Not the pattern — the case."

### Knowing When You Have Enough
Signal readiness when:
- The user has articulated a specific, non-obvious insight
- There's at least one concrete example or case
- There's a clear audience takeaway

Say: "We have enough material for a post. Ready to move to Structuring?"

## What NOT to Do
- Never generate draft prose during Extraction.
- Never answer your own questions.
- Never ask "how does that make you feel?"
- Never proceed to structuring without explicit user signal.
