# Content Structuring Skill

## When to Use
Active during Structuring. Load alongside `platform-linkedin` or `platform-twitter` depending on target.

## The Twelve Archetypes

| Archetype | Format signature | Best intent | Metric target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Framework Drop** | Named framework + 3 applications | Teach / Provoke | Saves |
| **Field Note** | Single war story → lesson | Demonstrate | Inner-ring DMs |
| **Bridge** | Domain A + Domain B = insight C | Connect / Bridge | Comments |
| **Micro-Learning** | Step-by-step with concrete examples | Teach | Saves + reshares |
| **Annotated Shelf** | Curated list with editorial notes | Curate | Saves + follows |
| **Hot Take** | Contrarian claim + evidence | Provoke | Comments + visits |
| **Visual Explainer** | Layered concept → visual structure | Teach | Saves + reshares |
| **Case Study** | Specific project → transferable lesson | Demonstrate | Inner-ring DMs |
| **Interview Transcript** | Q&A revealing perspective | Connect | Comments |
| **Retrospective** | Pattern across time | Demonstrate / Curate | Saves |
| **Tool Review** | Evaluation with specific criteria | Review / Curate | Saves + follows |
| **Origin Story** | How you got to a belief | Connect / Storyteller | Profile visits |

## Skeleton Building Protocol

### Step 1: Archetype Recommendation
State the archetype and why: "Given the material from Extraction, this is a [Archetype]. Here's why: [one specific reason tied to the content]."

### Step 2: Skeleton Components
```
HOOK LINE:      [One sentence. Creates cognitive tension or pulls reader in.]
CORE INSIGHT:   [The non-obvious thing. One sentence. If you can't state it in one sentence, it's not clear yet.]
KEY POINTS:     [Maximum 3. Each one is a supporting argument or example, not a summary.]
  1. [Specific point]
  2. [Specific point]
  3. [Specific point]
LANDING:        [What the reader does with this. Declarative. Not a question.]
```

### Step 3: Hook Review
The hook must:
- Create tension, curiosity, or recognition within 10 words
- NOT start with "I"
- NOT be a rhetorical question
- NOT start with context-setting

### What You Don't Do
- Don't write the post. Skeleton only.
- Don't suggest more than one archetype.
- Don't pad the skeleton with transition sentences.
- Don't put more than 3 key points.
