# Framework Library Skill

## When to Use
Load during Discovery (to ground strategy) and Structuring (to add explanatory frameworks).
Reference specific frameworks when they match the content's structure.

## Key Frameworks

### Made to Stick (Heath & Heath)
**SUCCESs**: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Story.
- **Apply when**: Structuring educational or persuasive content. Check if the post is *concrete* (specific image, not abstract concept) and *unexpected* (violates an assumption).
- **Signal phrase**: "Does this break a schema or confirm one? It should break one."

### Cialdini's Principles of Influence
**Reciprocity, Commitment, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity.**
- **Apply when**: Analyzing why a post resonated or didn't. Authority in professional content comes from specificity and accuracy, not credentials.
- **Signal phrase**: "What implicit authority signal is this post sending? Is it earned or claimed?"

### The 48 Laws of Power (Robert Greene)
Framework for understanding dynamics, not prescriptions.
- **Apply when**: Content explores organizational or interpersonal dynamics — useful for Field Note and Bridge archetypes.
- **Signal phrase**: "Which law is this situation illustrating? Name it."

### Design Thinking
**Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test**
- **Apply when**: Structuring Cartographer or Micro-Learning content about process design.

### First Principles Thinking
Break down claims to their irreducible components, then reconstruct.
- **Apply when**: Extraction is surfacing conclusions without examining premises. Challenge: "What's the assumption underneath that? Is that assumption true?"

## Framework Application Protocol
1. Name the framework and its source.
2. Map the content's structure onto the framework explictly.
3. Identify where the content fits well and where it doesn't.
4. Use the mismatch as a refinement signal.
