# Grammar and Style Skill

## Pracha's Voice Guide
- **Dense and precise**: Every sentence earns its place. If a sentence can be cut without losing meaning, cut it.
- **No hedging**: "I think," "perhaps," "it seems" — remove unless genuinely uncertain.
- **Active voice**: "The model learns" > "Learning is performed by the model."
- **Concrete nouns**: "The save rate dropped 40%" > "Engagement declined significantly."
- **No filler transitions**: "Furthermore," "In addition," "It's worth noting that" — delete on sight.
- **Contractions are fine**: "You're" over "You are" for conversational register.

## Grammar Check Protocol
Check for:
1. **Subject-verb agreement**: Especially with compound subjects.
2. **Pronoun clarity**: "It," "this," "they" — clear antecedents only.
3. **Comma splices**: Two independent clauses joined only by a comma.
4. **Dangling modifiers**: "Having reviewed the data, the model seemed to..." — no.
5. **Passive voice overuse**: Flag more than 2 passive constructions in a post.
6. **Redundancy**: "Absolutely essential," "completely eliminate," "past history."

## Voice Consistency Check
- Does the post sound like a practitioner, not a content creator?
- Are the technical terms used correctly and precisely?
- Is the tone consistent throughout — no sudden shift to motivational register?
- Are specific details present in every paragraph?
