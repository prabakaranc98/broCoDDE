# LinkedIn Platform Skill

## Formatting Rules
- **Character limit**: 3000 chars. Optimal: 1200–1800 chars.
- **No markdown**: LinkedIn renders asterisks and hashes as plain text. Use line breaks instead.
- **Paragraphs**: 1–3 sentences max per paragraph. Single blank line between paragraphs.
- **Hooks**: First 2 lines visible before "...see more" — make them count.
- **Lists**: Use dashes or numbers preceded by a line break, not bullet markdown.
- **Emojis**: Maximum 2 if used. None preferred for research/technical audience.

## Post Structure Conventions
```
[HOOK — 1-2 lines, no context-setting]

[Short setup paragraph — 2-3 sentences]

[Core argument or insight]

[Supporting point 1 — specific, concrete]

[Supporting point 2 — specific, concrete]

[Supporting point 3 — specific, concrete]

[Landing — declarative, no question, no CTA]
```

## Algorithm Notes (2026)
- Post in the first 2 hours of target audience's active time (US: 7–9am or 12–1pm ET)
- First 60 minutes determine distribution; engage with substantive early comments
- Save rate is primary distribution signal — optimize for saves, not likes
- Native content outperforms link-in-post
- Editing within first hour resets distribution window

## What NOT to Do
- No "hashtag spam" (2 max if used at all)
- No "What do you think?" ending
- No "I'm excited to share..."
- No tagging people who aren't directly referenced
- No reposting your own post in comments
