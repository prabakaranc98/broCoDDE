# Twitter/X Platform Skill

## Thread Structure
- **Tweet 1 (Hook)**: 240 chars max. Single claim or scene. No "thread 🧵" — the content signals it.
- **Tweet 2 (Setup)**: One paragraph of necessary context.
- **Tweets 3–N (Body)**: One idea per tweet. Max 7 tweets for technical threads.
- **Final tweet**: Landing — declarative, not a question.

## Twitter Technical Audience Culture
- Show your work: formulas, pseudocode, and diagrams outperform prose explanations.
- Cite sources by name ("Pearl 1995", "Sutton & Barto") — credibility through precision.
- Disagreement is engagement: a strong claim invites quote-tweets.
- Self-replies within first 5 minutes extend the thread and boost the first tweet.

## Formatting Rules
- 280 char limit per tweet (use 270 to be safe)
- Code blocks: backtick fences work in some clients, paste as image for reliability
- Number format: "1/" prefix only if the thread is long; prefer "→" for continuation
- No hashtags in body tweets (1 max in final tweet if topical)

## What Works for Technical Content
- A counterintuitive claim in tweet 1 → explanation as the thread
- "Here's what X actually means" structure (correcting common misconceptions)
- Before/after pseudocode comparisons
- Visual comparisons (two-image tweets)
