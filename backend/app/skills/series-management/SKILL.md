# Series Management Skill

## Series as Narrative Architecture
A series is not a collection — it's a designed arc. Each post must:
1. Stand alone (readable without the others)
2. Build on prior posts (a reader who followed the series gets more)
3. Advance the narrative arc (the series goes somewhere)

## Gap Identification
Before suggesting a new task direction, check:
- Which series are active? What's their current post count vs. target?
- What's missing from the series arc? (Opening, middle, application, edge case, retrospective?)
- Which series hasn't had a new post in 30+ days?

## Narrative Arc Patterns

### Micro-Learning Series (e.g., Causal Discovery in 4 Posts)
```
Post 1: The intuition — why this matters, what problem it solves
Post 2: The mechanism — how it works at the conceptual level
Post 3: The implementation — concrete steps or code
Post 4: The edge cases — where it breaks, when not to use it
```

### Bridge Series (e.g., The Pracha Bridge)
```
Each post: Domain A concept × Domain B concept = synthesized insight
The series: Progressively harder syntheses, building vocabulary
```

### Field Note Series (e.g., From the Trenches)
```
Each post: One specific situation → one transferable lesson
The arc: From tactical failures to strategic patterns
```

## Series Continuity Checks
- Does the new post reference or extend a prior post in the series?
- Does the archetype match the series archetype, or is this deliberate variation?
- Is the domain consistent, or is there a justified bridge?
