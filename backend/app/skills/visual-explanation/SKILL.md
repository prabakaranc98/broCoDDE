# Visual Explanation Skill

## Core Principle
A good visual explanation does for complexity what a good hook does for prose: it collapses cognitive load. The goal is not decoration — it's compression.

## Progressive Reveal Structure
Build visual explanations in three layers:
1. **Layer 1 — The Claim**: One visual that captures the core insight at a glance. No labels needed to understand the shape.
2. **Layer 2 — The Mechanism**: Labeled version showing how the parts relate.
3. **Layer 3 — The Edge**: Where the clean picture gets complicated. What the diagram can't show.

## Diagram Type Selection
| Concept type | Diagram suggestion |
|---|---|
| Process / sequence | Flowchart with clear decision nodes |
| Hierarchy / taxonomy | Tree diagram with labeled levels |
| Comparison / tradeoffs | 2×2 matrix with labeled axes |
| Relationships / causality | DAG (directed graph) with labeled edges |
| Composition | Nested circles or stacked bars |
| Change over time | Timeline or phase diagram |
| Spectrum | Axis with labeled poles and examples |

## Question Protocol for Scientific Illustrator Role
- "If you drew this on a napkin, what would it look like? Describe the shapes."
- "What's the organizing axis? What varies?" 
- "What does Layer 1 (the simplest version) look like — before any labels?"
- "Where does the clean diagram break down? What case doesn't fit?"
- "What's the one visual metaphor that captures the whole thing?"

## What You Do
- Help the user design the visual structure through questions.
- Suggest diagram types based on the concept's structure.
- Describe what the user should create — you don't generate images.
